Richard's path to becoming a professional natural bodybuilder is a story of incredible perseverance and strength. On February 28, 2020, his life took a sudden turn when he suffered a traumatic brain injury that left him paralyzed. Most people would have been overwhelmed by such a devastating setback, but Richard refused to give up. Over the next year, he fought tirelessly to regain his mobility, eventually relearning how to walk. His recovery was nothing short of miraculous, a testament to his unbreakable spirit.



But Richard's challenges didn't end there. Just a few months after his injury, he faced another life-threatening obstacle: toxic mold sickness. This illness wreaked havoc on his body, causing him to lose 50 pounds and leaving him with severe, itchy eczema that covered his skin. As if that wasn't enough, Richard was later diagnosed with a serious inflammatory autoimmune disease. Over the next three and a half years, he endured hundreds of life-threatening allergic and autoimmune reactions. Yet, through it all, Richard remained determined to overcome every hurdle in his way.
